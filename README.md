# Go + SvelteKit Example

This repository demonstrates how to combine SvelteKit and Go to build a dynamic frontend application and serve it efficiently using Go. The main goal is to deliver a single Go binary that embeds your SvelteKit Single Page Application (SPA).

## Quick Overview

- **Frontend**: Built with SvelteKit, configured with a static adapter for smooth client-side routing.
- **Backend**: Uses Go's standard library to serve the pre-built SvelteKit application and handle API endpoints if needed.

## Getting Started

To understand how to build and serve a SvelteKit SPA using Go, check out the full step-by-step guide in the accompanying article. You'll learn how to configure the SvelteKit project, embed it in Go, and handle routing with minimal boilerplate code.
